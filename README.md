ENIAC A/B Test - Optimizing "SHOP NOW" Button Performance

Overview

This repository is dedicated to analyzing an A/B test conducted to optimize the performance of the "SHOP NOW" button on a website. The goal of the experiment was to determine which version of the button resulted in the highest conversion rate (click-through rate or CTR).

Experiment Design

Marketing requested the Design team to create multiple versions of the "SHOP NOW" button to see if changes in color and text would impact user engagement. The following versions were tested:

Version A: Original site (control group)

Version B: Changed the button color to red

Version C: Changed the button text to "SEE DEALS"

Version D: Combined changes from Version B and C (red button + "SEE DEALS" text)

The objective of this experiment was to identify which version had the best performance in terms of CTR.
